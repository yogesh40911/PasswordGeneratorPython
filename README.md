# If you are learning a python then try to learn step by step with small amazing projects.

Password generator using python is simplest where we had to use two imports modules are:-
Random Module:
Random module is used to perform the random generations. We are making use of random.sample module here. If you will observe in the output all characters will be unique. random.sample() never repeats characters.

String Module:
The string module contains a number of useful constants, classes and a number of functions to process the standard python string.
